Skills and abilities to acquire
================================
The knowledge and abilities you will acquire are to:

A. design, build, configure, program and test an electronic system for a specific engineering problem observing common professional practice.
B. demonstrate you understand how computers work, from the digital logic level to how they execute basic programming constructs.
C. write reports about the design process and its results.
D. engage in team-based design and creative tasks to solve an engineering problem.
